### Comprehension check in OOP
#### 1. What's a class?
A class is used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something.

#### 2. What's an instance?
An instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

##### 3. What's the relationship between a class and an instance?
An instance belongs to a class.

#### 4. What's the Python syntax for defining a new class?
We define a new class by using the keyword class and the name of the class using CamelCase notation starting with an uppercase letter.
For example, if we want to define the class of animals:
```.py
class Animals:
```

#### 5. What's the spelling convention for a class name?
The spelling convention for a class name is using CamelCase notation.

#### 6. How do you instantiate, or create an instance of, a class?
We define an instance of a class by using the initializer(__init__())method to initialize(eg., specify)an object's initial attributes by giving them their default value. This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable, which refers to the object itself. 

#### 7. How do you access the attributes and behaviours of a class instance?
By printing the statement using dot notation to acess attributes of a class instance.

#### 8. What's a method?
They are functions defined inside a class and are used to define behaviours of the objects. They can also be used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects.

#### 9. What's the purpose of self?
Self 

#### 10. Whats's the purpose of the __init__ method?
The __init__ method is used when creating an instance by attaching the name and age to the object. It is an initializer. 

#### 11. Describe how inheritance helps prevent code duplication.

#### 12. Can child classes override properties of their parents?
