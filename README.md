# Unit-3
## Planning
### Definition of problem
The client for this application is Hassan Ali, a lover of perfumes. He has so much perfumes of different brands, sizes and content. They all smell soo good and sometimes he can spend lots of minutes thinking of what perfume to use for heading out for school. This action comes at his expense because he usually misses breakfast and comes late for his first period classes.
Hassan has also found it hard to account for his numerous perfumes. He tends to lose a lot of them and it has become a hell of a job to organize his perfumes.
