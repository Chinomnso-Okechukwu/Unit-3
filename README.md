## Planning
### Definition of problem
The client for this application is Hassan Ali, a lover of perfumes. He has so much perfumes of different brands, sizes and content. They all smell soo good and sometimes he can spend lots of minutes thinking of what perfume to use for heading out for school. This action comes at his expense because he usually misses breakfast and comes late for his first period classes.
Hassan has also found it hard to account for his numerous perfumes. He tends to lose a lot of them and it has become a hell of a job to organize his perfumes. 

### Proposed solution
I am going to create an application that helps Hassan organize his perfumes in the form of an inventory. On opening the application, there would be a feature that informs Hassan on the recommended perfume to use that particular day.   

### Success Criteria
1. Application must be secure. No other person should be able to gain unauthorized access.
2. There should be a recommended perfume for that season when the client opens the application.
3. Click system to check out or use perfume and informs client when perfume was last used.
4. Client should be able to create or add a new perfume to his inventory.
5. Client should be able to delete or remove an existing perfume from his inventory.
6. Client should be able to edit a perfume in his inventory.
7. Application should be visually pleasing.
8. Application should be easy to use.
