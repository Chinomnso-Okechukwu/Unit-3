### For my dream computer, I would need:

#### A device to receive or display text, images from my computer.
#### A device to click or select icons on my computer.
#### A device to give instructions to the computer on how to go about various instructions and operations.
#### A device to receive sound output incase I want to listen to music from my computer or watch a movie.
#### A device to input sound into my computer.
#### A device to store information on my computer.
#### A device to hold components together.

### I would buy a:
#### Monitor
#### Keyboard
#### Mouse
#### CPU
#### Speakers
#### Microphone
#### RAM, ROM, Cache Memory 
#### Motherboard
#### Scanner
#### Printer

### Mechanism
I input text data into my computer, through my keyboard. This data is converted to a series of 0's and 1's (binary digits) that the computer can understand. The data is then sent to the Central Processing Unit where it is stored for a bit(very short time actually) in the memory devices, then processed. When the data has been processed, it means that the computer understands my request and has answered it. After this, it returns the data as information in the form of the text through the screen. 
The same procedure goes if I input images or sound. The only difference is the input and output devices for the various media.
