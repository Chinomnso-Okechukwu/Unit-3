## TELOS feasibility study
Feasibility study is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed project or system. A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of an existing business or proposed venture, opportunities and threats present in the natural environment, the resources required to carry through, and ultimately the prospects for success[1]. 

Undertaking a feasibility study is very necesary because it helps recognize whether it is justificable to venture into developing a new system. It is basically just a possibility study, knowing whether something can be acheived or if it is possible. Feasibilty studies are applicable to any area of work whether it is business, web develpoment, medicine. Even in developing this application for my client, I would be taking some time to assess whether it will be feasible to continue with this project.

In order to fully acheive this assessment, I would be assessing using TELOS. TELOS is used to define five areas of feasibility that determine whether a project should run or not.

TELOS is an acronym that stands for Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational, Schedulling.

#### T- Technical- Is the project technically possible?
The project is technically possible.
#### E- Economic- Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?
The project can be afforded. I already possess a laptop and it was free to download PyCharm and Qtdesigner. However, this application is not profit or money driven so it will not increase profit. 
#### L- Legal- Is the project legal?
This project is legal. It does intefere or challenge with any of the rules listed in the Code of Conduct of UWC or with the rules of the Japanese government. The intent of developing this application is also not malicious but to offer aid.
#### O- Operational- How will the current operations support the change?
The current operations support the change. We have been learning and practising programming for some months.
#### S- Schedulling- Can the project be done in time?
This will depend on the time set by my client which we have not discussed yet. When the intended time has been set, then I can say whether or not it can be done in time. In spite of this, I will try and work towards producing the prototype for this application sometime before the deadline. That way, I would be able to get feedback from my client on how to improve.
