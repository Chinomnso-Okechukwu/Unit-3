|---|---|---------|---|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0       | 0 | 0               | 1               |

### Q3. Define the term protocol.

### Q4. Outline the role of memory data register in the machine execution cycle.
The Memory data register receives the instruction at the memory address from the memory address register. The MDR also acts as a two-way register that holds data fetched from memory or data waiting to be stored in memory (it is also known as the memory buffer register (MBR) because of this). Eventually, the instruction in the MDR is copied into the current instruction register (CIR).

### Q5. A code for representing colours is used, where each colour is stored using 7 bits. State the number of different colours that can be represented.
The number of colours that can be represented are 2^7 colours = 128 colours.
